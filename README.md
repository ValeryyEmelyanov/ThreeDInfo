# 3D Printing Info Site
Overview
This project is a website dedicated to providing comprehensive information about 3D printing. The site covers the main problems associated with 3D printing, dissects the construction of 3D printers, and provides links to various printers and material reviews. Future plans for the site include integrating a Telegram bot for accessing a collection of 3D models for printing and dialoguing, as well as developing a formula for calculating 3D printing costs based on 3D models.

Features
Detailed Articles on 3D Printing Problems: In-depth analysis of common issues faced in 3D printing.
Printer Construction Breakdown: Detailed breakdowns of 3D printer components and how they work.
Printer and Material Reviews: Reviews and links to different 3D printers and printing materials.
Future Plans:
Telegram Bot Integration: A bot that provides access to a collection of 3D models and supports user interaction.
3D Printing Cost Calculator: A formula to estimate the cost of 3D printing based on the model specifications.
